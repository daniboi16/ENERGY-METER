# SMART ENERGY METER
I this project I have stepped into the field of IOT in order to implement a smart energy meter. 
In 2020 lockdown, I did a mini project with minimal knowledge to implement a smart energy meter in principle with various simulations. 
As I had not done any actual hardware work I was not satisfied so the following year in 2021, I implemented the project again addressing the mistakes I made in the previous 
year. 

I have used a nodeMCU, NodeRED and python to implement this project. The codes for this project is available in the “CODES” folder with a description of each.
