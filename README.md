# SMART ENERGY METER
I this project I have stepped into the field of IOT in order to implement a smart energy meter. 
In 2020 lockdown, I did a mini project with minimal knowledge to implement a smart energy meter in principle with various simulations. You can find my final report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mnrD40SlVL4sMDcDv35eLEvT5e6kW38S/view?usp=sharing) 
As I had not done any actual hardware work I was not satisfied so the following year in 2021, I implemented the project again addressing the mistakes I made in the previous 
year. You can find my final report on the subject [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KILSe-9xSmCF043nnkgm5VKD3qw5Gm28/view?usp=sharing) as well as screen shots with the 
relevant details [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLnFU00dtMd_f9a_D8zKFrAc79m2ZOdm/view?usp=sharing)

I have used a nodeMCU, NodeRED and python to implement this project. The codes for this project is available in the “CODES” folder with a description of each.
